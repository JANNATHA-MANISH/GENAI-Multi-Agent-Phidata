### **High-Level Design (HLD)**
#  **Market Research & Use Case Generator**

## **Overview**

The **Market Research & Use Case Generator** is a system that allows users to input a company’s URL, extract its content, generate AI/ML use cases from the extracted content, and fetch relevant datasets from **Kaggle**. It integrates third-party APIs like **Tavily** for content extraction, **Google Gemini** for AI use case generation, and **Kaggle** for fetching related datasets.

The system consists of several modules, including the **User Interface (UI)**, **API Integrations**, **Data Processing** modules, and **Output Handling** for saving the results in structured formats like `.csv` and `.txt` files.

## **Key Components**

### **1. User Interface (UI)**
The UI is built using **Streamlit** and provides a user-friendly platform for interacting with the system. Users can input a company URL, and the UI displays the generated use cases, datasets, and other results.

### **2. API Integrations**
The application integrates with the following third-party APIs:
- **Tavily API**: Extracts content from the provided company URL.
- **Google Gemini API**: Generates use cases and keywords based on the extracted content.
- **Kaggle API**: Fetches datasets related to the generated keywords.

### **3. Data Processing**
- **Content Extraction**: The Tavily API extracts content from the URL provided by the user.
- **Use Case Generation**: The Google Gemini API analyzes the extracted content to generate use cases and keywords.
- **Dataset Fetching**: The Kaggle API is used to fetch datasets based on the generated keywords.
- **Data Aggregation**: The system aggregates the extracted use cases and relevant datasets into a comprehensive format, suitable for further analysis or usage.

### **4. Output Handling**
The results are presented to the user in both `.txt` (for use cases) and `.csv` (for datasets) formats. The system also allows the user to download or view these files.

## **Module Details**

### **1. User Interface (UI)**
The UI is built with **Streamlit**, a Python library that enables fast web development. The UI allows users to input a company’s URL and click a button to trigger the analysis process. The system then displays the results, including generated use cases and fetched datasets.

**Main Features**:
- **Text Input**: For users to input the company’s URL.
- **Button**: To start the analysis and fetch data.
- **Results Display**: Shows the generated use cases, keywords, and datasets.
- **Download Options**: Provides links to download the generated `.csv` and `.txt` files.

### **2. Tavily API Integration**
Tavily is used to extract content from the provided URL. The content can include text, images, and metadata. We are primarily interested in the raw text content for generating use cases.

**Steps**:
1. Extract the URL provided by the user.
2. Use the Tavily API to fetch raw content from the website.
3. Send the raw content to the next module for further processing.

### **3. Google Gemini API Integration**
**Google Gemini** is a powerful natural language model that generates use cases, AI applications, and keywords based on the extracted content. It processes the raw content and breaks it into actionable insights.

**Steps**:
1. Feed the extracted content into the Google Gemini API.
2. Generate use cases with detailed descriptions, objectives, AI applications, and cross-functional benefits.
3. Extract keywords that are relevant to the use cases for the dataset search.

### **4. Kaggle API Integration**
The **Kaggle API** is used to fetch relevant datasets based on the keywords generated by Google Gemini. The datasets are retrieved and linked to the use cases for further exploration.

**Steps**:
1. Use the generated keywords to search for relevant datasets on Kaggle.
2. Fetch the top 5 datasets related to the keywords.
3. Link these datasets to the respective use cases.

### **5. Data Aggregation**
This module combines the generated use cases with relevant datasets. It structures the data into a readable format and allows it to be saved into `.csv` and `.txt` files.

**Steps**:
1. For each use case, find the associated datasets.
2. Aggregate the data into a structured format.
3. Save the results in `.csv` and `.txt` formats for easy access.

## **Database Schema and Tables**

| **Table Name**            | **Description**                                               | **Columns**                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **UseCases**               | Stores generated use cases based on extracted content.         | `ID`, `Title`, `Description`, `AI_Application`, `Cross_Functional_Benefit`, `Keywords`          |
| **Datasets**               | Stores information about fetched datasets.                     | `ID`, `Dataset_Name`, `Dataset_Link`, `Source`, `Keywords`                                    |
| **AggregatedResults**      | Combines use cases and datasets into a final output.           | `ID`, `UseCase_ID`, `Dataset_ID`, `Dataset_Name`, `Dataset_Link`, `Source`                    |

## **Error Handling and Logging**

### **Error Handling Strategy**
1. **Tavily API**: If the content extraction fails, the system will display an error message indicating the failure.
2. **Google Gemini API**: In case of a failure in generating use cases or keywords, the system will log the error and prompt the user with a message.
3. **Kaggle API**: If datasets are not found or the API fails to fetch them, the system will handle the error gracefully and display a message to the user.

### **Logging**
- Use **Python’s `logging` module** for tracking errors and debugging information.
- All errors will be logged with timestamped entries for traceability.

---

## **Security and Compliance**

1. **Authentication**: 
   - Secure API keys for **Tavily**, **Google Gemini**, and **Kaggle** are stored in environment variables, ensuring that no sensitive data is exposed in the code.
2. **Data Privacy**: 
   - No personal data is collected from the user; the system only uses the company URL to perform analysis.

## **Conclusion**

This **High-Level Design (HLD)** outlines the structure and architecture of the **Market Research & Use Case Generator** application. The system efficiently processes company URLs, generates use cases and keywords, fetches relevant datasets, and aggregates the results in user-friendly formats. By utilizing third-party APIs like **Tavily**, **Google Gemini**, and **Kaggle**, the application provides valuable insights into AI/ML opportunities related to any given company's market presence.
